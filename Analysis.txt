Task 0
This algorithm most likely runs in some form of constant time, like O(2).

Task1
This algorithm most likely runs in some form of linear time, like O(2n).

Task2
This algorithm most likely runs in some form of linear time, like O(2n).

Task3
This algorithm most likely runs in quadratic time, something like O(n^3) due to the number of nested loops.

Task4
This algorithm is most likely runs in some version of linear time, something like O(3n).
